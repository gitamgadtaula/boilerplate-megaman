                    <p>
                        As lifelong gamers ourselves, we know adding gaming aspects to <i>anything</i> can add excitement, entertainment and simply put, irresistibility! Much like the ever-changing innovative games we see out on the market today, we want this token to represent outside-the-box and modern thinking.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        As it stands, the majority of community tokens involve the primary goal of getting the word out but offer very little to extinguish one from the other. With this in the forefront of our minds, we envision MegaMan Token offering a unique series of limited edition NFTs and <span style="color:#75BADB" v-b-modal.megababy>iNFTs</span>, the latter of which has yet to be seen in the cryptocurrency space!
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        This is only a small glimpse into the many new innovative ideas that will roll out as the token reaches new heights. We are excited to be on this adventure with you, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MegaManArmy&src=typed_query">#MegaManArmy</a>!
